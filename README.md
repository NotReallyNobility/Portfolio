# Portfolio
A portfolio of my work, showcasing my skills.
https://github.com/NotReallyNobility/Portfolio.git

It contains a home page which shows two of my most recent projects, an about me page that talks on my motivations, and a projects page which showcase my most impressive projects, with each project having it's own page explaining it. From there it links to github.

Each page has a footer linking to github and linkedIn.
