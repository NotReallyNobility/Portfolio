                        <p>Fazbear Entertainment is a fan made website based on the company Fazbear Entertainment from the multimedia franchise Five Nights at Freddy's. I've always harbored a powerful fondness for this series, and seeing that no else had done it already, it was only fitting that I should make a website for the evil twin of Chuck E. Cheese. The website is a fun experience, containing several secrets hinting at the dark secrets Fazbear Entertainment is trying to bury but always fail to bury deep enough.</p>
