            <h1>Creating Games And Stories To Sympathize With Our Most Hated Parts.</h1>
            <div class="whiteBack">
                <p>In the modern day, a lot of people are often dealing with varying degrees of self loathing, including myself. There's parts of ourselves we start to despise, be they for how others perceive you or how it may interfere with certain parts of your life.</p>
                <p>I've grown up on the autism spectrum, which in the past has caused me to struggle with social cues and have to take some years of speech classes to properly express my thoughts. This isn't even mentioning autistic outbursts that occured before my diagnosis and proper coping mechanisms were introduced to me by professionals. I was lucky to have been diagnosed very young.<p>
                <p>No matter how much my parents assured me I was a good kid, I always grew up feeling wrong to a degree. I felt like this part of me was something horrible, unnatural.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="whiteBack">
                <p>I've learned to accept this part of me, to understand that something different is okay, to love something so wholeheartedly that it steers my dreams is okay.</p>
                <p>I grew up loving stories and all the ways they're expressed, especially video games. My love for Five Nights at Freddy's is the main reason I became so inspired to become a software developer, because if Scott Cawthon could do all that, so can I.</p>
                <p>I code, I create, to give back all that I received. To put in enough genuine love and passion into my every action and keystroke that just maybe some other kid can understand it's okay to love something so completely.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="whiteBack">
                <p>In terms of experience, I am currently going through the College of Western Idaho's Software Development Advanced Technical Certificate program. As is, I am fairly inexperienced but eager to learn and grow.</p>
                <p>I believe the current best showcase of my talents is the FazbearDotCom project. That project came about exclusively through assets created without a website in mind.</p>
                <p>I believe the ingenuity shown in reutilizing video game assets and trailer clips and converting them into coherent pieces of a website in such a visually appealing manner shows a large amount of talent. I personally consider ingenuity to be among, if not the most important trait for a software developer, no matter what language they're coding in, or what product they're producing.</p>
